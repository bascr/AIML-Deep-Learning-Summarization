FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) American law enforcement has a fundamental duty to \\n        provide compassion, aid, and protection and safety to the \\n        people it serves.\\n            (2) A primary function of law enforcement is to preserve \\n        life, regardless of the race, ethnicity, religion, social or \\n        economic standing, sexual preference, or country of origin of \\n        the individuals involved.\\n            (3) Over many years, thousands of cases of State and local \\n        law enforcement agency violations of suspects, detainees, and \\n        prisoners went inadequately addressed across the United States, \\n        especially in African-American communities and other \\n        communities of color or poverty.\\n            (4) In recent years, procedures, training, and public \\n        oversight have failed to significantly curb or eliminate abuses \\n        and murders of innocent suspects and citizens at the hands of \\n        officers of the law, to fully investigate claims of excessive \\n        use of force, or to adequately reprimand, punish, or remove \\n        such offenders or their superiors.\\n            (5) A special prosecutor in Chicago has been investigating \\n        a police abuse ring that operated over three decades with \\n        impunity, responsible for torturing over 200 African-American \\n        males in their custody at the Area 2 and Area 3 police \\n        headquarters.\\n            (6) Since the 1997 New York Police Department torture of \\n        Abner Louima, and the fatal shooting of Amadou Bailo Diallo in \\n        1999, public and media attention concerning abuse of power and \\n        the unjustified and improper use of force by law enforcement in \\n        communities of color has continuously increased, as have the \\n        number of outraged community responses and the demands for \\n        external oversight of police practices.\\n            (7) More recently, police in Chicago on November 25, 2006, \\n        police officers in New York City shot 50 times and killed an \\n        unarmed man, Sean Bell. The next day, a community rally \\n        protested the police action and called for the removal of \\n        Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.\\n            (8) Fatal shootings and abuse of suspects and prisoners \\n        have come to light again recently in other cities, including \\n        Atlanta, Georgia, and DeKalb County, Georgia.\\n            (9) Every major State and local city law enforcement agency \\n        receives and depends on some level of Federal funding, \\n        training, grants, or assistance, paid for primarily from the \\n        tax revenues of the citizens being abused.\\n            (10) The common and continuing unaccountable behavior and \\n        silence of members of law enforcement agencies regarding these \\n        abuses are a disgrace to the efforts of law enforcement \\n        agencies throughout the United States and should not be \\n        tolerated.\\n            (11) The lack of transparency, oversight, community \\n        involvement, independent review and investigation, and \\n        consequences to the law enforcement violators makes continuing \\n        abuse more likely, and must be reversed by denying Federal \\n        funding to any law enforcement agency that fails to establish a \\n        minimum of professional training and procedures of engagement; \\n        that tolerates abuses or fatal use of excessive force; that \\n        fails to operate under rules of transparency and community \\n        oversight, investigation, and review; that fails to discipline, \\n        remove, or otherwise hold accountable any perpetrators acting \\n        under the color of law enforcement; or that refuses to fairly \\n        hear each case or allegation of possible abuse or excessive use \\n        of force by law enforcement officers, reviewed by an \\n        established and independent forum.\\n\\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\\n\\n    It is the sense of Congress that the dishonorable actions referred \\nto in section 2 should be independently investigated, recorded, and \\ncondemned.\\n\\nSEC. 4. INELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of \\nenactment of this Act, or until transparency and accountability are \\nfully restored, law enforcement agencies that do not have established \\nprocedures for independent oversight and review, or do not hold \\nviolations by police of excessive use of force, torture, or \\nmanslaughter accountable, shall be ineligible to participate in any \\nFederal program, whether by funding, assistance, contract, grant, \\npersonnel support, or otherwise.\\n    (b) Licenses.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of \\nenactment of this Act, any Federal license issued to any such law \\nenforcement agencies shall be suspended, or until transparency and \\naccountability are fully restored.\\n    (c) Equipment.--Law enforcement agencies identified as carrying out \\nabuses or wrongful deaths, without consequence or open public review or \\nallegations, shall immediately return all federally-owned equipment in \\nthe possession or use of such law enforcement agencies to the \\nappropriate Federal agency.\\n\\nSEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEFINED.\\n\\n    In this Act, the term ``law enforcement agencies'' means the \\nfollowing entities in any State or locality within the control and \\njurisdiction of the United States receiving Federal funds for training, \\nequipment, or other support.</td>\n",

       "3247  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency \\nand Accountability Act of 2006''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) American law enforcement has a fundamental duty to \\n        provide compassion, aid, and protection and safety to the \\n        people it serves.\\n            (2) A primary function of law enforcement is to preserve \\n        life, regardless of the race, ethnicity, religion, social or \\n        economic standing, sexual preference, or country of origin of \\n        the individuals involved.\\n            (3) Over many years, thousands of cases of State and local \\n        law enforcement agency violations of suspects, detainees, and \\n        prisoners went inadequately addressed across the United States, \\n        especially in African-American communities and other \\n        communities of color or poverty.\\n            (4) In recent years, procedures, training, and public \\n        oversight have failed to significantly curb or eliminate abuses \\n        and murders of innocent suspects and citizens at the hands of \\n        officers of the law, to fully investigate claims of excessive \\n        use of force, or to adequately reprimand, punish, or remove \\n        such offenders or their superiors.\\n            (5) A special prosecutor in Chicago has been investigating \\n        a police abuse ring that operated over three decades with \\n        impunity, responsible for torturing over 200 African-American \\n        males in their custody at the Area 2 and Area 3 police \\n        headquarters.\\n            (6) Since the 1997 New York Police Department torture of \\n        Abner Louima, and the fatal shooting of Amadou Bailo Diallo in \\n        1999, public and media attention concerning abuse of power and \\n        the unjustified and improper use of force by law enforcement in \\n        communities of color has continuously increased, as have the \\n        number of outraged community responses and the demands for \\n        external oversight of police practices.\\n            (7) More recently, police in Chicago on November 25, 2006, \\n        police officers in New York City shot 50 times and killed an \\n        unarmed man, Sean Bell. The next day, a community rally \\n        protested the police action and called for the removal of \\n        Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.\\n            (8) Fatal shootings and abuse of suspects and prisoners \\n        have come to light again recently in other cities, including \\n        Atlanta, Georgia, and DeKalb County, Georgia.\\n            (9) Every major State and local city law enforcement agency \\n        receives and depends on some level of Federal funding, \\n        training, grants, or assistance, paid for primarily from the \\n        tax revenues of the citizens being abused.\\n            (10) The common and continuing unaccountable behavior and \\n        silence of members of law enforcement agencies regarding these \\n        abuses are a disgrace to the efforts of law enforcement \\n        agencies throughout the United States and should not be \\n        tolerated.\\n            (11) The lack of transparency, oversight, community \\n        involvement, independent review and investigation, and \\n        consequences to the law enforcement violators makes continuing \\n        abuse more likely, and must be reversed by denying Federal \\n        funding to any law enforcement agency that fails to establish a \\n        minimum of professional training and procedures of engagement; \\n        that tolerates abuses or fatal use of excessive force; that \\n        fails to operate under rules of transparency and community \\n        oversight, investigation, and review; that fails to discipline, \\n        remove, or otherwise hold accountable any perpetrators acting \\n        under the color of law enforcement; or that refuses to fairly \\n        hear each case or allegation of possible abuse or excessive use \\n        of force by law enforcement officers, reviewed by an \\n        established and independent forum.\\n\\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\\n\\n    It is the sense of Congress that the dishonorable actions referred \\nto in section 2 should be independently investigated, recorded, and \\ncondemned.\\n\\nSEC. 4. INELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of \\nenactment of this Act, or until transparency and accountability are \\nfully restored, law enforcement agencies that do not have established \\nprocedures for independent oversight and review, or do not hold \\nviolations by police of excessive use of force, torture, or \\nmanslaughter accountable, shall be ineligible to participate in any \\nFederal program, whether by funding, assistance, contract, grant, \\npersonnel support, or otherwise.\\n    (b) Licenses.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of \\nenactment of this Act, any Federal license issued to any such law \\nenforcement agencies shall be suspended, or until transparency and \\naccountability are fully restored.\\n    (c) Equipment.--Law enforcement agencies identified as carrying out \\nabuses or wrongful deaths, without consequence or open public review or \\nallegations, shall immediately return all federally-owned equipment in \\nthe possession or use of such law enforcement agencies to the \\nappropriate Federal agency.\\n\\nSEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEFINED.\\n\\n    In this Act, the term ``law enforcement agencies'' means the \\nfollowing entities in any State or locality within the control and \\njurisdiction of the United States receiving Federal funds for training, \\nequipment, or other support.   \n",

       "      <td>Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act - Directs Federal functional regulators, within six months of this Act's enactment, to prescribe regulations requiring any designated payment system to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to: (1) identify restricted transactions by means of code in authorization messages or other means and to block such transactions; and (2) prevent the acceptance of the products or services of the payment system in connection with a restricted transaction. Defines a \"restricted transaction\" as any transaction or transmittal to anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering in connection with another person's participation in unlawful Internet gambling of credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or the proceeds of any other form of financial transaction as regulators may prescribe. Requires such regulators and the Federal Trade Commission to enforce such regulations (under applicable law in the manner provided under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) after considering specified factors concerning the extent of the violation, the history of compliance, and the feasibility and burden of implementing a remedy. Requires regulators to consider exempting restricted transactions if the regulators find that it is not reasonably practical to identify and block, or otherwise prevent, such transactions.Provides that no provision of this Act shall be construed as affecting any law relating to, affecting, or regulating gambling within the United States.</td>\n",

       "755  Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act - Directs Federal functional regulators, within six months of this Act's enactment, to prescribe regulations requiring any designated payment system to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to: (1) identify restricted transactions by means of code in authorization messages or other means and to block such transactions; and (2) prevent the acceptance of the products or services of the payment system in connection with a restricted transaction. Defines a \"restricted transaction\" as any transaction or transmittal to anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering in connection with another person's participation in unlawful Internet gambling of credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or the proceeds of any other form of financial transaction as regulators may prescribe. Requires such regulators and the Federal Trade Commission to enforce such regulations (under applicable law in the manner provided under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) after considering specified factors concerning the extent of the violation, the history of compliance, and the feasibility and burden of implementing a remedy. Requires regulators to consider exempting restricted transactions if the regulators find that it is not reasonably practical to identify and block, or otherwise prevent, such transactions.Provides that no provision of this Act shall be construed as affecting any law relating to, affecting, or regulating gambling within the United States.   \n",
